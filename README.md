## Project Structure

This monorepo contains three main components:

### ðŸŽ¨ [Excalidraw](./Excalidraw/README.md)
The frontend drawing interface, built on top of the open-source Excalidraw project.
- Hand-drawn style whiteboard interface
- Collaborative features
- End-to-end encryption
- Custom AI agent integration
- Requires yarn for package management

### ðŸš€ [Apollo-GraphQL-API](./Apollo-GraphQL-API/README.md)
The backend service handling agent management and drawing operations.
- GraphQL API for agent interactions
- Storage and management of agents, prompts, and capabilities
- AWS infrastructure
- Docker containerization
- Organization-level authorization through Clerk

### ðŸŽ¯ [Agent-Lab](./Agent-Lab/README.md)
The administrative interface for managing the system's AI components.
- Create, edit, and delete collections of agents, capabilities, and prompts
- Uses pnpm for package management
- Includes a playground tab for testing agents

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20.x or later)
- pnpm (for Agent-Lab and Apollo-GraphQL-API)
- yarn (for Excalidraw)
- Docker
- AWS CLI
- Terraform CDKTF

## Architecture

The system uses a microservices architecture:
